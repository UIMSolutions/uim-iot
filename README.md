The **Internet of Things (IoT)**, also known as **IdD** (German: *Internet der Dinge*), is a collective term for technologies that create a global infrastructure connecting physical and virtual objects. These technologies enable objects to communicate with each other through information and communication techniques. Here are the key points about IoT:

1. **Definition**: The IoT encompasses the interconnection of uniquely identifiable physical objects (referred to as "things") with their virtual representations within a structure similar to the internet. It extends beyond human participants to include objects themselves.

2. **Origins**: The term "Internet of Things" was coined by **Kevin Ashton** in 1999, although it was not formally documented. The concept gained prominence through the activities of the "Auto-ID Labs." Automatic identification technologies like **RFID** are often considered foundational for the IoT, but they lack direct communication via internet protocols.

3. **Vision**: The vision of the IoT aligns with **ubiquitous computing**, where sensor-equipped objects seamlessly integrate into our environment. These objects become pervasive, imperceptible to direct human awareness, and capable of supporting various activities. For instance, miniaturized computers with sensors can be directly embedded in clothing (known as **wearables**).

4. **Goal**: The primary goal of the IoT is to automatically capture relevant information from the real world, link it together, and make it available within the network. While physical objects have specific states (e.g., "air is cold," "printer toner is full"), this state may not be directly accessible in the network.

In summary, the Internet of Things enables the seamless interaction between people and electronically connected systems, as well as interactions among the systems themselves. It has significant implications for various domains, including business, society, and daily life..
